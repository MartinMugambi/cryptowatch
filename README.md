 # CryptoWatch - Flutter Application
 Cryptowatch is an android  application that fetches latest details about the cryptocurrency market from coingecko API. The application displays the most viewd crypto coins in the market.
 
 I created this repository for a few reasons:
 1. To learn the approch of implementing clean architecture and [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID#:~:text=The%20SOLID%20concepts%20are%3A,%2C%20but%20closed%20for%20modification.%22) in an android app.
 2. To learn libraries/tools supported by Google and most of the android development communities.
 3. To experiment and interact with API request.
 4. Demonstrate best developement practices by utilizing up to date tech-stack .
